Get ready to learn!

## Job Search

The job search is all about yourself, what you **like**, what you are **good at** and what are you **expectations and ambitions**.

While searching for a job you should ask yourself: "*What added value can I bring to the company that is hiring me?*"

This is usually composed of **Experiences** (Work, volounteering, associations, extra-curricular, personal), **Passions and interests** and your **Hard and Soft Skills**.

*What do we mean by Hard and Soft Skills?*
**Hard Skills** have usually to do with your work and academic experience: your ability of knowing the topics of the field and being able to **do the tasks** you've been assigned to. An example for a software development would be the ability to code.
**Soft Skills** on the other hand are more general characteristics that have to do with the ability of **communicate, empathise, motivate, etc** . These are usually developed through direct experience in group projects, association actitives and other similar hands on approaches. 

*How can communicate my abilities and capabilities to a recruiter?*
You can do so using the documents you will send them: **Curriculum Vitae, Cover Letter**, your socials like **LinkedIn** and finally face to face in the **Interview process**.

*How can I handle all this aspects and get the job position or internship that I want?*
We will now go through each one of them giving general **best practices** and some suggestions

### Curriculum Vitae (CV)

Writing a good CV is one of the main topic of discussion when trying to apply for a job position or internship.

These are some general best practices:
1. **One page** only! Be **concise**!
    Generally the person that will go through your CV (or algorithm e.d.) won't have time to read it though carefully (or will prefere a shorter CV if it is an algorithm e.d.) and will get only the most crucial parts of your CV, so be sure to put those into evidence when writing it!
2. **Customise** it for the company you're applying for!
    Generally companies will look for different abilities of the candidate, so a slight customisation could go a long way, in particular if companies are very different between each other.
3. **Chronological Order** from the most recent to the oldest!
    Generally activites you've done and objetives you've achieved more recently are more relevant. If something is very old, question its importance taking also time into account.

Also the podcast from the CareerService gives advices on how to write a good CV. It can be found [here](https://www.spreaker.com/show/my-turn_3).

### Cover Letter

Covers your story, resumes the parts of your life relevant from the company.

It shouldn't be too long (20 lines, divided in 4 paragraphs) a general good practice of dividing it is the following:

1. **Introduction** describe who you are and why you are applying
2. **Description** of the skills that make you the ideal candidate
3. **Motivation** why do you want to work in this company?
4. **Conclusion** express your availability to set up an interview and collaborate with a company

A different take suggests to use the same structure but to use **metaphors** in particular in the first paragraph to *hook* the reader into continue reading more.

### LinkedIn

It's crucial to have an updated and curated profile because for many recruiters it's the first thing they see looking for us. 

Be sure to always:

* Have your **Custom URL**, a **updated profile picture** and a **background picture**
* Insert a proper **Job title** and **Key words** relevant to you
* **Keep** your profile **updated** with your experiences, skills, projects, contact info
* **Connect** with the right people and **join groups** on LinkedIn based on your interests

### Interview Process

There are different kinds of interview that test different things. This depends on the interview process, this can vary from company to company. Be sure to know how the interview process of the company you're applying to works. 

* **Phone call**: verifies is you are interested in the company and in the position
* **HR interview**: verifies your motivation and soft skills. It's sometimes also called *Behavioural Interview*
* **Technical & coding interview**: verified your hard skills. This can be formed of more different interview, for instance a data science position would go through both coding and data science specific interview

Be sure to ask some question yourself at the end of the interview, this shows your interest and pictures yourself to the eyes of the interviewer in that position. Some topics to ask about are: **role**, **tech used**, **team**, **company**.

To conclude, having an idea of the interview works and prepare for it. Develop both **hard skills** and **soft skills**, but in the end show who you really are. 

*Only you is you, and they haven't hired someone like you yet*

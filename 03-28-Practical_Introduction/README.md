Greetings coder!

Hands-on sessions are here. Today, we will be reviewing the fundamental data structures commonly used in coding interviews. From arrays to linked lists and hash tables, we will briefly examine the properties of a structure, and see how it can be applied to solve problems efficiently. Using LeetCode exercises as a guide, we will practice implementing these data structures and using them to train our minds.

Get ready to sharpen your problem-solving skills!

Greetings coder!

It is time to explore trees and graphs, two essential data structures commonly required in coding interviews. Our focus will be on how they can be used to model real-world problems and, in particular, by using two traversal algorithms: depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). Their differences and advantages will be discussed, as well as their implementation to solve LeetCode questions. By the end of this session, you will be equipped with great tools to solve complex problems in the tech industry.

Get ready to sharpen (again) your problem-solving skills!

Greetings coder!

Welcome to the last technical meeting, where we will be exploring the problem-solving technique of dynamic programming (DP). We will approach DP at a high level, without diving into mathematical proofs. However, we would like to stress the discussion of the underlying concepts as precisely as possible since, even though we recognize that DP can be a challenging topic, very few courses in the B.Sc. and M.Sc. programmes proposed by [PoliMi](https://www.polimi.it/en) explain this methodology in-depth.

Get ready to sharpen (yet another time) your problem-solving skills!

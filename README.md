# Overview

Dear fellow coder, welcome to *StartBig*! Here, you are going to embark on an adventure in the beautiful world of tech interviews, one of the most challenging aspects regarding jobs in the engineering area or related divisions of a company, especially when speaking about big techs (MAANG).

We suggest you to clone or fork the repository in order to try solving the problems of the technical meetings.

Happy coding!
